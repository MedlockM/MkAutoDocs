# MKAutoDocs Code Documentation Repository

Everthing on here has been generated by gpt

This repository showcases the use of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model for generating documentation for code automatically. The generated documentation is then turned into a "doc as code" site for easy access and sharing.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, you will need to have a valid OpenAI API key for GPT-3.5 language model and a codebase that you want to generate documentation for.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file located in the root directory of the project.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Edit the configuration file to point to your code repository.
5. Run `python Auto_Doc.py` to generate documentation for your code.
6. Use MkDocs to turn the generated documentation into a "doc as code" site. Run `mkdocs serve` to preview the site or `mkdocs build` to generate a static website in the `site` directory.
